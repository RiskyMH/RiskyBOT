The RiskyBOTs are [`RiskyBOT`](../about), [`RiskyBOT 2`](../about/riskybot-2), [`RiskyBOT Canary`](../about/riskybot-canary)

The differences between them are **RiskyBOT** is the standard bot with only slash commands, **RiskyBOT 2** has some slash commands but is primarily chat based, and **RiskyBOT Canary** is the unavailable beta bot

### Commands/features

**RiskyBOT**

- `/fun`: some funny commands
- `/search`: can search some places (eg. [Urban Dictionary](https://urbandictionary.com/))

**RiskyBOT 2**

- `message`: message yourself (the bot DMs you)
- `say`: uses web-hooks to say a message (requires **webhooks** perm)
- This bot also reacts/replies to certain words (eg *hello* reacts with *ðŸ‘‹*)

*currently only for testing the bots*\
*\* this basically uses both commands*

**All**
