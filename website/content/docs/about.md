RiskyBOT is a Discord bot that can do random things. It generally does things that are informative (eg. translate/fun), and it tries to use the latest discord features.

It was made for trying to implement the new features, this means that it wont ever be close to other Discord bots feature wise. It currently implements `slash commands` for most features, and `user menu`, `buttons` for some easier way to use the commands.

### Commands ([list](https://trello.com/b/XpQuJz82/riskybot-commands))
- `/about`: information about a user/role
- `/deep-ai`: uses [Deep-AI](https://deepai.org/) to make some interesting responses
- `/translate`: uses [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) to translate text
- `/fun`: some funny commands
- `/search`: can search some places (eg. [Urban Dictionary](https://urbandictionary.com/))
- `/tools`: some commands that might be-able to help you
- `/random`: produces some random results
- Not as useful:
   - `/aboutme-credits`: displays information about its-self and what's used to make it
   - `/ping`: shows the ping and if the bot is actually online (more useful when testing)
- and more coming soon
