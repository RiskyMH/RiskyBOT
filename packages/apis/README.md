# `@riskybot/apis`

A set of functions to get/use APIs for the [RiskyBOT](https://github.com/RiskyMH/RiskyBOT) project

### Notes
This is not fully designed to be used as a library, but rather as a way to get the APIs for the project.

This package is subject to change at any time, and may not be stable (not fully semver).
