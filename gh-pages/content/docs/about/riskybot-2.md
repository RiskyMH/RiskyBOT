This bot was made because RiskyBOT doesn't use the `bot scope`, this means that it cannot do text-based commands.

### Commands:
- `/message`: message yourself (the bot DMs you)
- `/say`: uses web-hooks to say a message (requires **webhooks** perm)
- This bot reacts/replies to certain words (eg *hello* reacts with *ðŸ‘‹*)
- Not as useful:
   - `/aboutme-credits`: displays information about its-self and what's used to make it
   - `/ping`: shows the ping and if the bot is actually online (more useful when testing)

*some more information at [tips & tricks](../tips-tricks)* 

### Permissions: 
- `Webhooks`: for say command
- `Reactions`: For reacting to some words (earlier mentioned)
- `External Emojies`: Some commands will need it or makes better (say command)
- Obvious permissions
    - `Read-Messages`: To see the messages
    - `Send-Messages`: to reply to those messages
