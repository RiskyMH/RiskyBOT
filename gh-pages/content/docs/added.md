Thank you for adding this bot

* to see the functionality go to [about](../about)
* to see some cool things the bot can so go to [tips & tricks](../tips-tricks)
* the server for this bot is [here](https://discord.gg/34sQduaUh2)
* and some FAQs go to [faq](../faq)

### Possible issues
* Since the bot only uses slash commands if scope of  `make slash commands` (when adding the bot) doesn`t exist the bot is useless
